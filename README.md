# X Scraper

A PHP web scraper working with a european car dealer's website. 
This code is presented only for a presentation, it's not meant to be used 'as is'. 

The scraper supports proxy servers and is basically bulletproof because of the techniques used in code to detect any failures and fix them during the execution. Also it supports multiple instances, that is the UI has controls to start scraping at different locations which comes handy quite often.
